I packaged this up a couple of months ago but here is the official blog post
for [backbone-filtermodule](https://github.com/azundo/backbone-filtermodule).
Documentation is in the README and examples in the examples directory.

The goal is to provide a view that nicely filters a collection based on
multiple criteria and allows for animation. Originally I created this for the
[AVC Team Page](http://avc.azundo.com/people/). You can see a simple example at
[http://azundo.github.io/backbone-filtermodule/examples/shapes.html](http://azundo.github.io/backbone-filtermodule/examples/shapes.html).
