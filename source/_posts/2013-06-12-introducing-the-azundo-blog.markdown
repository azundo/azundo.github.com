A new day and a new blog. As I transition from my past role as a Market
Development Specialist with Engineers Without Borders Canada toward a more
technically focused time, I thought it might be useful to start a more
technical blog. At one point I had intended to write about technical things
over at http://theborrowedbicycle.ca but I'll keep that for thoughts on
personal and human development instead of design and engineering.

The intention of this blog is to keep track of what I'm learning and thinking
about as I get my coding chops back to re-enter the technical world.  Right now
my goal is to simply use this blog to record my progress and learnings for
myself and to continue to work on my writing skills and technical
communication.  I've got a few projects that I hope to blog about as I work on
them over the summer, aiming to land a job as a software engineer starting in
September.
